# Mixed-language-programming using ALP and C

There are times when programs need to call programs written in other languages referred as mixed language programming. For example, when a particular subprogram is available in a language other than language you are using, or when algorithms are described more naturally in a different language, you need to use more than one language. Mixed-language programming always involves a call to a function, procedure, or subroutine. Mixed-language calls involve calling functions in separate modules. Instead of compiling all source programs with same compiler, different compilers or assemblers are used as per the language used in the programs. Microsoft C supports this mixed language programming. So it can combine assembly code routines in C as a separate language. C program calls assembly language routines that are separately assembled by-MASM (MASM Assembler). These assembled modules are linked with the compiled C modules to get executable file. 

As we all know that mixed language programming is supported by C.
Other high level languages that support assembly language programming:
1.C++
2.Basic
2.FORTRAN
